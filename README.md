# JARVIS---AI-VOICE-ASSISTANT-
Python-based offline AI voice assistant using local LLM (Phi) and NewsAPI

Jarvis is a **Python-based AI voice assistant**, similar to **Alexa**, built as a student project to understand how real voice assistants work by integrating **AI, voice recognition, APIs, and system automation**.

The assistant uses a **free local AI model (Phi)**, making it **offline-capable**, **privacy-friendly**, and **cost-free** — perfect for learning and experimentation without paid APIs.

## ✨ Features

- 🗣️ Voice-controlled interaction with wake word **“Jarvis”**
- 🧠 AI-powered answers using **locally integrated AI (Phi via Ollama)**
- 🌐 Open websites like Google, YouTube, LinkedIn
- 🎵 Play music via predefined links
- 📰 Fetch and read **live news headlines** using NewsAPI
- 🔒 Works mostly **offline** (AI runs locally)

> ⚠️ Note: Since this project uses a **free local AI model**, responses may be **slower than commercial assistants like Alexa**, but it is fully functional and ideal for student use.
